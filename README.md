# lowbudget

Welcome to the [LowbudgetLCS](https://lowbudgetlcs.com) website! This repo
contains both the front and backend.

## Running

To run locally, you can either run `npm i` and `npm dev` in either client/ or
server/ to run a development version, or use the convenient `Makefile` included
to build and run docker images for both. 

Don't forget to create a .env file in client and server filled in from the
example file!
